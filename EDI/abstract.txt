Eddy covariance data (carbon dioxide, methane) collected at the deepest site of Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) every 30-minutes from April 2020 to May 2021. Falling Creek Reservoir is a drinking water supply reservoir owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority (WVWA). The data set consists of a range of variables collected and calculated using an Eddy Covariance system (LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) and associated Eddy Pro software (Eddy Pro Version 7.0.6), including carbon dioxide and methane fluxes. Additional scripts are included for further data processing and QA/QC.
